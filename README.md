## 📋 Executive Summary
This project delivers an end-to-end data science pipeline to analyse and forecast crime patterns across Greater London. By integrating disparate datasets from the **Greater London Authority (GLA)** and **Transport for London (TfL)**, our team has developed a "Fusion" engine that correlates transit-related incidents with borough-level safety metrics.

The goal is to provide actionable intelligence through:
1. **Automated ETL Pipelines:** Cleaning and merging messy spatio-temporal datasets.
2. **Predictive Modelling:** Assessing the suitability of machine learning models for borough-level crime forecasting.
3. **Advanced Visualisation:** High-fidelity animated choropleth maps and interactive safety dashboards.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Task Breakdown
Our group followed a modular development workflow, divided into three core pillars:

### 🔹 Part 1: Data Fusion & Correlation (Lead: [Your Name/Teammate])
* **Objective:** Establish the relationship between crime on transport networks vs. crime within the boroughs.
* **Tech:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`.
* **Key Outcome:** Statistical validation of multi-modal crime correlations, identifying "high-friction" transit hubs.

### 🔹 Part 2: Spatio-Temporal Visualisation (Lead: [Teammate Name])
* **Objective:** Transform static data into dynamic insights using geospatial mapping.
* **Tech:** `Geopandas`, `Plotly Express`, `Folium`.
* **Key Outcome:** Animated choropleth maps showing the evolution of crime hotspots over time across 32 London boroughs.

### 🔹 Part 3: Predictive Suitability Engine (Lead: [Teammate Name])
* **Objective:** Build and evaluate a predictive model to forecast future crime trends.
* **Tech:** `Scikit-Learn`, `XGBoost`, `Statsmodels`.
* **Key Outcome:** A critical assessment of model performance, determining the feasibility of algorithmic crime forecasting for city planning.
